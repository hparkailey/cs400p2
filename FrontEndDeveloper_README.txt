FrontEnd.java: This is the class that runs the main method. It interacts with the user by receiving their input and performing whatever task they want (either to create a reservation, search through the reservations based on dates, or search through the reservations based on a name). It holds the main screen and will switch to any screen the user desires.

FrontEndDeveloperTests.java: This is the class that tests the FrontEnd.java class.
